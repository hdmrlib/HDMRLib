# HDMRLib

**HDMRLib** is an open-source Python library for **High-Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR)** and **Enhanced Multivariate Products Representation (EMPR)**. It provides a unified workflow for decomposition, component analysis, and lower-order reconstruction across **NumPy**, **PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow** backends.

## Features

- HDMR and EMPR in one library
- Unified decomposition workflow
- Component extraction and lower-order reconstruction
- NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow support
- Documentation, examples, and tests

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install hdmrlib
```

For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hdmrlib/HDMRLib.git
cd HDMRLib
pip install -e .
```

For optional backend dependencies and development tools, see the documentation.

## Quick Example

```python
import numpy as np
from hdmrlib import HDMR

X = np.random.rand(10, 10)

model = HDMR(X, order=2)

X_reconstructed = model.reconstruct()
components = model.components()
```

This computes a second-order HDMR decomposition of `X`, reconstructs the data from the decomposition, and returns the extracted component terms.

The same workflow also applies to `EMPR`:

```python
from hdmrlib import EMPR

model = EMPR(X, order=2)
X_reconstructed = model.reconstruct()
components = model.components()
```

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at:

- **Documentation website:** https://hdmrlib.github.io/HDMRLib/

## Supported Backends

HDMRLib currently supports:

- **NumPy** for standard array-based workflows
- **PyTorch** for tensor computation and backend-integrated workflows
- **TensorFlow** for TensorFlow-based numerical workflows

Backend selection is handled through a unified interface, allowing the same decomposition workflow to be used across supported numerical libraries.

## Testing

To install development dependencies and run the test suite:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest
```

If you want to test optional backends as well:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,all]"
python -m pytest
```

# Library Organization and Workflow Overview

This page provides a high-level overview of the main HDMR-Lib objects and the typical workflow used throughout the user guide.

HDMR-Lib is organized around a small set of core interfaces for decomposition and backend management. In most workflows, users will:

1. prepare input data
2. choose a backend if needed
3. create a decomposition object
4. inspect the extracted components
5. reconstruct lower-order approximations

## Core objects

The main user-facing decomposition classes are:

- **EMPR** for Enhanced Multivariate Products Representation
- **HDMR** for High-Dimensional Model Representation

Both follow the same high-level usage pattern. A decomposition object is created from input data and a target decomposition order.

```python
import numpy as np
from hdmrlib import EMPR, HDMR

X = np.random.rand(10, 10)

empr = EMPR(X, order=2)
hdmr = HDMR(X, order=2)
```

In both cases, the resulting object stores the computed decomposition and provides methods for inspecting or reconstructing it.

## Decomposition objects

A decomposition object represents the result of applying EMPR or HDMR to input data.

Once created, the object is typically used through two main methods:

- `components()` to access extracted component terms
- `reconstruct()` to rebuild the data from the decomposition

This gives a consistent workflow across both formulations:

```python
components = empr.components()
X_reconstructed = empr.reconstruct()
```

The same pattern applies to `hdmr`.

## Working with components

The `components()` method returns the component terms produced by the decomposition.

These components are typically organized by term names that indicate the corresponding lower-order structure or interaction terms. For example, users may request only selected terms:

```python
selected = empr.components(elements=["g_0", "g_1", "g_2", "g_1,2"])
```

Use `components()` when you want to inspect the decomposition itself rather than only its reconstruction.

## Working with reconstructions

The `reconstruct()` method returns a reconstruction of the original data based on the computed decomposition.

```python
X_full = empr.reconstruct()
X_order1 = empr.reconstruct(order=1)
```

A full reconstruction uses all computed terms up to the decomposition order. Passing `order=...` returns a lower-order approximation using only terms up to the requested order.

This is useful when studying how well lower-order structure explains the original data.

## Backend management

HDMR-Lib supports multiple computational backends. The main backend utilities are:

- `set_backend(...)` to select a backend
- `get_backend()` to inspect the currently active backend

For example:

```python
from hdmrlib import set_backend, get_backend

set_backend("numpy")
backend = get_backend()
```

This allows the same high-level workflow to be used across supported backends such as NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

In many cases, the default backend is sufficient. Backend selection becomes more relevant when integrating HDMR-Lib into tensor-based or GPU-enabled workflows.

## Typical workflow

A typical HDMR-Lib workflow looks like this:

### 1. Prepare the input
Organize the input data into a supported tensor or array format.

### 2. Select a backend if needed
Use `set_backend(...)` when you want to work with a specific computational backend.

### 3. Create a decomposition object
Instantiate `EMPR(...)` or `HDMR(...)` with the desired decomposition order.

### 4. Inspect the component terms
Use `components()` to examine lower-order terms and selected interactions.

### 5. Reconstruct approximations
Use `reconstruct()` to obtain the full decomposition-based reconstruction or lower-order approximations.

## How to read the user guide

The user guide is organized around the main stages of this workflow:

- **Quick Start** gives a minimal end-to-end example
- **Prepare Input Data** explains input requirements and conventions
- **Run a Decomposition** describes the main decomposition interfaces and options
- **Inspect Components** explains how to access and interpret extracted terms
- **Reconstruct Data** shows how to build lower-order approximations
- **Backends** covers backend selection and usage
- **Troubleshooting** summarizes common issues and fixes

Users new to the library should usually start with **Quick Start** and then continue through the workflow pages in order.

## When to use the API Reference

The user guide explains the typical workflow and main concepts. The **API Reference** is most useful when you need detailed signatures, implementation-level options, or module-specific documentation.

For most first uses of the library, the workflow pages in the user guide should be sufficient.
